## Embedding figures and tables in google docs

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

When presentation are created in PowerPoint format and stored in a google drive folder, they become linkable resources. Individual slides can be embedded in other google docs as figures or tables.

# Slide Section - Level 1 Headings Are Used to Group Sections

## Level 2 Headings Create and title New Slides

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A new slide, without a title can also be started with a horizontal rule**

```{r}
#| label: push to google drive
#| echo: false
#| include: false

# There are three ways to push 
# - easiest: mount a google drive folder on your desktop and use file.copy()
# - use googledrive::drive_upload to copy the output to an arbitrary folder (more complicated, but more general)
# - setup a quarto project, and use the output_dir and post - rendering options (not recommended)

target_dir = "rendered_slides"

file.copy(paste0(params[["src_filename"]],".pptx"), 
          params[["target_dir"]]) 
dir()

```
